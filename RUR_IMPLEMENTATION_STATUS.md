# RUR C++ Implementation Status Report

## Overview
This is a C++ port of the Julia RationalUnivariateRepresentation.jl package for computing Rational Univariate Representations (RUR) of polynomial systems. The RUR algorithm converts a multivariate polynomial system into a univariate representation, which is useful for solving systems of polynomial equations.

## What the Software Currently Does

### Completed Components

1. **Julia-style Data Structures** ✅
   - Power products (PP) representation
   - Modular coefficient types (ModularCoeff, AccModularCoeff)
   - StackVect structure for border exploration
   - All basic data structures matching Julia implementation

2. **Multiplication Tables** ✅
   - `prepare_table_mxi()` - Constructs border structure and variable indices
   - `learn_compute_table()` - Fills multiplication tables for quotient ring arithmetic
   - `mul_var_quo()` - Performs multiplication in quotient ring using tables
   - Complete implementation of quotient ring arithmetic infrastructure

3. **Bivariate Lexicographic Algorithm** ✅
   - `biv_lex()` - Core algorithm for extending univariate to bivariate parameterization
   - `convert_biv_lex_2_biv_pol()` - Converts bivariate representation to polynomial form
   - Gaussian reduction over finite fields
   - Complete bivariate monomial handling

4. **Multi-modular Computation Framework** ✅
   - Prime generation utilities
   - Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) implementation
   - Rational reconstruction algorithms (multiple strategies)
   - Combined CRT + rational reconstruction pipeline
   - Support for GMP arbitrary precision arithmetic

5. **F4 Gröbner Basis Integration** ✅
   - axf4 wrapper providing C++ interface to F4 algorithm
   - **NEW**: Structured data extraction API avoiding string parsing
   - Functions: `axf4_get_basis_size()`, `axf4_get_poly_data()`, `axf4_get_leading_term()`
   - Proper data lifecycle management with `axf4_compute_groebner_basis_keep_data()`
   - Ready for efficient integration with multiplication tables

6. **Existing Infrastructure**
   - Basic polynomial types and operations
   - FLINT library integration for polynomial arithmetic
   - Various solver attempts (FlintRURSolver, DirectRURSolver) - but these appear incomplete

### What is Incomplete or Missing

1. **Main RUR Algorithm** ❌
   - The core `_zdim_modular_RUR` functions that orchestrate the entire computation
   - Separating element selection strategies (current, random, deterministic, l0_norm, mron_0l)
   - The main loop that runs modular computations and combines results

2. **Univariate Parameterization** ❌
   - `_zdim_parameterization()` - Computes the univariate parameterization
   - RUR polynomial construction from parameterization data
   - Handling of the radical ideal computation

3. **Quotient Basis Bridge** ❌ **[CRITICAL PATH - IN PROGRESS]**
   - `extract_quotient_basis()` - Extract standard monomials from F4 Gröbner basis
   - `compute_fill_quo_gb()` - Fill quotient ring from Gröbner basis
   - Bridge between F4 structured API and multiplication table framework
   - **Note**: Expert review confirmed no FGLM needed - works directly with degrevlex

4. **F4 Learning/Replay Mechanism** ⚠️
   - `_gb_4_rur_learn()` and `_gb_4_rur_apply()` equivalents for multi-modular efficiency
   - Apply learned tables to new primes (optimization, not critical for MVP)

5. **Main Entry Points** ❌
   - `zdim_parameterization()` - Main user-facing function
   - Input parsing and validation for polynomial systems
   - Output formatting for RUR results

6. **System Extension** ❌
   - `extend_system_with_sepform()` - Extends system with separating element
   - `swap_vars()` - Variable swapping for separating element optimization

7. **Verification and Utilities** ❌
   - `rur_check()` - Verification of RUR results
   - Parallelization support for multi-modular computations
   - Composite number arithmetic for efficiency

## What Needs to be Added Before Running as a Solver

### Critical Path Components (in order):

1. **Quotient Ring Construction from Gröbner Basis**
   ```cpp
   // Need to implement:
   - compute_fill_quo_gb() 
   - Extract quotient basis from F4 results
   - Build multiplication tables from Gröbner basis
   ```

2. **Univariate Parameterization Algorithm**
   ```cpp
   // Need to implement:
   - _zdim_parameterization()
   - Compute characteristic polynomial of multiplication matrix
   - Extract RUR polynomials from parameterization
   ```

3. **Main Modular RUR Algorithm**
   ```cpp
   // Need to implement:
   - _zdim_modular_RUR_current() (and other strategies)
   - Separating element selection
   - Integration of all components
   ```

4. **Multi-modular Loop**
   ```cpp
   // Need to implement:
   - _zdim_multi_modular_RUR()
   - Prime selection and management
   - Parallel computation support
   - Result combination using CRT
   ```

5. **Main Entry Point**
   ```cpp
   // Need to implement:
   - zdim_parameterization() equivalent
   - Input parsing (from polynomial expressions)
   - Output formatting (RUR format)
   ```

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Requirements:

1. **Complete the univariate parameterization** - This is the core mathematical algorithm
2. **Integrate F4 with multiplication tables** - Connect Gröbner basis to quotient ring
3. **Implement basic separating element strategy** - At least the "current" strategy
4. **Create simple main function** - Basic input/output for testing
5. **Single-threaded implementation** - Defer parallelization for later

### Suggested Implementation Order:

1. **Week 1**: Quotient ring from Gröbner basis + F4 integration
2. **Week 2**: Univariate parameterization algorithm
3. **Week 3**: Main modular RUR with basic separating element
4. **Week 4**: Multi-modular loop and main entry point
5. **Week 5**: Testing and debugging with known examples

## Current State Summary

**What works:**
- All low-level arithmetic and data structures ✅
- Multiplication tables for quotient rings ✅
- Bivariate extension algorithm ✅
- Multi-modular arithmetic framework ✅

**What's missing:**
- The main RUR algorithm that ties everything together ❌
- Connection between F4 and multiplication tables ❌
- Univariate parameterization computation ❌
- User-facing interface ❌

The foundation is solid, but the core algorithmic components that make this a working RUR solver are not yet implemented. The next step should be implementing the quotient ring construction from Gröbner basis results, as this is the bridge between what exists and what's needed.
